I am currently working on setting up the template skeleton and project structure for Trackk. The setup includes the following:

•	Development Tools: Husky, TypeScript, Commit Lint, ESLint
•	Project Environment: Express.js
•	Error Handling: Global error handler, 404 handler
•	Logging & Debugging: Logger, Source Map
•	Database: PostgreSQL, Database log storage, Database migrations
•	Health Monitoring: Health endpoint
•	Security: Helmet.js, CORS, Rate limiting
•	Maintenance: Dependency updates
•	Deployment & Authentication: Docker, Clerk, Supabase
•	Multi-Tenancy: Dynamic domain name setup
•	Subscription Management: Logic for Basic, Pro, and Standard plans

By the end of the day, I aim to have everything set up with a single user configuration.
